Add digital noise artifacts to the banana. Keep the background unchanged.

**Target:**
- Apply effects ONLY to the banana itself
- Background must remain exactly as-is

**Effect (Medium Intensity):**
- Visible RGB color separation/fringing along banana edges
- Scattered pixel artifacts and small blocky glitches on the surface
- A few noticeable horizontal glitch lines cutting through the banana
- Some color distortion patches (shifted hues, not neon)

**Intensity: MEDIUM**
- The noise should be clearly visible, not hidden
- Viewer notices something is wrong within a few seconds
- Looks like a slightly corrupted image file
- The banana shape is still clear, but obviously glitched

**Balance:**
- More than barely-visible, less than overwhelming
- Digital artifact aesthetic, not destroyed image
- Noticeable but not aggressive
